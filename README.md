# vim-config

My vim configuration. This is still a work in progress, as I am only now expanding my vim aresenal!

## Usage

1.  Clone the repository
2.  Symlink repository's `.vim/` directory to `~/.vim/`
3.  Create a `~/.vimrc` file with the following line:
    `source path/to/vim-config/.vimrc`
    
After following the above steps, you should be able to make changes solely in the repository directory.
